# This is ZapRecall!

Do you ever create small notes to remember subjects that you're studying, so you can keep them fresh inside your head? Say no more!

<img src='./src/Assets/screenshot-demo-zaprecall.jpeg' />

With ZapRecall, you get a deck with your subject of choice, with randomly-sorted small questions that will help you remember those small notes that you've written.

Just "Start Recall", open a question, and when you turn it back (pressing the circle-arrow), answer appropriately:

ðŸŸ© "Zap!" if you immediately knew the answer. (Green goes for Great!)

ðŸŸ¨ "Quase nÃ£o lembrei" if it took you some thinking to remember the answer (Yellow for... "Yup... I guess?")

ðŸŸ¥ "NÃ£o lembrei" if you didn't actually know the answer beforehand (I've got no puns for the Red color I'm sorry)
